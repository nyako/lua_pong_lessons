# Introduction

This is an introduction to basic computer programming with [Lua](https://lua.org/) and LÖVE ([love2d.org](https://love2d.org/)).

Lua is a lightweight high-level programming language, designed to be embeddable in a wide variety of applications. A well-known example that uses Lua is the Roblox gaming platform.

LÖVE is a programming framework for building 2D games in Lua.

In this tutorial, you will learn how to write computer code to make the game classic called [Pong](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pong).

The main objective of this tutorial is to give students an express route to coding without having to deep dive into Computer Science concepts.

Before you begin, you will need to install LÖVE. The installation instructions can be found at [https://love2d.org/wiki/Getting_Started](https://love2d.org/wiki/Getting_Started).

You will also be needing a text editor. The built-in Notepad on Windows or TextEdit on Mac OS should work fine; but if you prefer more sophisticated editors, there are plenty of options to choose from, such as Visual Studio Code (vscode), Atom or Sublime.
